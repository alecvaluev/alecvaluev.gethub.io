The majority of tables in a database are of this type. Examples: students, employees, orders, products | | -- | -- | | Lookup Table | The purpose is to centralize data to avoid repeated data groups. A common use of a lookup table is to populate a dropdown list on a website or user interface., Often lookup tables are parent tables in relationships. Examples: Provinces, Countries, Colours, Manufacturers, Gender, Transmission Type | | Junction/Bridge Table | A third table created between two tables to simulate a many-to-many relationship through two opposite 1-to-many relationships. Junction or Bridge tables can often contain data as well, based on the dependencies between the data and the two parent primary keys. | | Temporary Table | A table that has limited lifetime in a database. Often these table lack referential integrity, are not manually manipulated, break several fundamental database design rules, but has a very distinct purpose in a database. These purposes could include:</p><ul><li>moving data from one table to another or importing data from an external source</li><li>migrating an old database design to a new database design</li><li>the static storage of query results to minimize repeated processing required for complex calculations.
