It consists of data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class.</p><h2 id="object" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#object" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Object</h2><p>An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated. An object has an <strong>identity, state, and behavior</strong>. Each object contains data and code to manipulate the data.</p><h2 id="data-abstraction" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#data-abstraction" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Data Abstraction</h2><p>Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation.</p><h2 id="encapsulation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#encapsulation" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Encapsulation</h2><p>Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. In Encapsulation, the variables or data of a class are hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through any member function of their class in which they are declared.</p><h2 id="inheritance" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#inheritance" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Inheritance</h2><p>Inheritence is the capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class.</p><h2 id="polymorphism" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#polymorphism" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Polymorphism</h2><p>The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.</p><p>Types:</p><ul><li>run time <ul><li>virtual function</li></ul></li><li>compile time <ul><li>function overloading</li><li>operator overloading</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="dynamic-binding" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dynamic-binding" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dynamic Binding</h2><p>In dynamic binding, the code to be executed in response to the function call is decided at runtime. Dynamic binding means that the code associated with a given procedure call is not known until the time of the call at run time.</p><h2 id="message-passing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#message-passing" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Message Passing</h2><p>It is a form of communication used in object-oriented programming as well as parallel programming. Objects communicate with one another by sending and receiving information to each other. A message for an object is a request for execution of a procedure and therefore will invoke a function in the receiving object that generates the desired results. Message passing involves specifying the name of the object, the name of the function, and the information to be sent.</p>',22),o=[s];function r(c,d){return a(),i("div",null,o)}const l=e(n,[["render",r],["__file","concepts.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
