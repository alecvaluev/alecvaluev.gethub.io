# NoSQL

Each NoSQL database has its own unique features. At a high level, many NoSQL databases have the following features:

- Flexible schemas
- Horizontal scaling
- Fast queries due to the data model
- Ease of use for developers

## Types of NoSQL databases

- **Document databases** store data in documents similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. Each document contains pairs of fields and values. The values can typically be a variety of types including things like strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or objects.
- **Key-value databases** are a simpler type of database where each item contains keys and values.
- **Wide-column stores** store data in tables, rows, and dynamic columns.
- **Graph databases** store data in nodes and edges. Nodes typically store information about people, places, and things, while edges store information about the relationships between the nodes.

## When should NoSQL be used?

following factors lead to selecting a NoSQL database:

- Fast-paced Agile development
- Storage of structured and semi-structured data
- Huge volumes of data
- Requirements for scale-out architecture
- Modern application paradigms like microservices and real-time streaming
