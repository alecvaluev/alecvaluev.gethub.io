# Red Black Trees
`Red-Black Trees` are binary search trees that are named after the way the nodes are coloured.

> The height of a red black tree is at most 2 * log(n+1).

A red black tree must maintain the following colouring rules:
1. every node must have a colour either red or black.
2. The root node must be black
3. If a node is red, its children must be black (note that this also implies that red nodes cannot have red parents)
4. Every path from root to a null node must have exactly the same number of black nodes

:::tip Note
`null nodes` are also sometimes called `null leafs`.  these are not really nodes.. they are the "nodes" that null pointers point to...
