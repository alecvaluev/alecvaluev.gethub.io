you don’t speak in 존댓말;

out loud and asking the other people around you at the same time. 반말 is used in this case
as well.

## “당신” and “you” / 당신

> in reality, native Korean speakers rarely use the word ‘you’ in sentences, especially when speaking in 존댓말, or formal language.

You can use the word 당신 when:
1. you are angry at someone and don’t mind fighting or arguing with that person;
2. you are translating from a foreign language and you absolutely must have a word for ‘you’;
3. you are writing or singing a song, or are using indirect language in general;
4. you are addressing your spouse (commonly used among middle-aged or older people);
5. (rare case) you are talking about someone (who is not present) in an honorific way and
want to say ‘he’ or ‘she’.

### Usage 1
```
당신 뭐야?
= Who do you think you are? / What are you?

당신 뭐가 문제야?
= What’s your problem?
```
Using 당신 in this fashion evokes the feeling that you really don’t mind getting in a quarrel or
a fight with the other person. Note that you are not speaking entirely in 존댓말 anymore. If
you are already speaking in 반말, you would say “너”.

### Usage 2 & 3
```
당신의 눈은 참 아름다워요.
= Your eyes are so beautiful.
당신에게 이 노래를 바칩니다.
= I dedicate this song to you.
```
You are forced to use 당신 here because you do not know the name of the other person
without context.

### Usage 4
```
당신 지금 어디예요?
= Honey, where are you?
```
Other words which can replace 당신 in this usage are 여보 (most common) and 자기 (more
common among young couples).

### Usage 5

This is becoming more and more rare. Often at times, people drop the word 당신 simply
out of fear of being misunderstood.

### in 반말

say ‘너’
> 너 + 는 [topic] = 너는
>
> 너 + 가 [subject] = 네가 (written) or 니가 (spoken)

### in 존댓말

say the name of the other person and add suffixes such as `-씨`, `-님`, or a word which describes his or her position or job title.
```
현우 씨 지금 시간 있어요?
= (Talking to 현우) Do you have time now?
최경은 선생님, 어디예요?
= (Talking to teacher 최경은) Where are you?
기사님, 여기에서 내려 주세요.
= (Talking to the taxi driver) Please drop me off here.
```
