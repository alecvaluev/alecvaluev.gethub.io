as well.

:::
## “당신” and “you” / 당신

> in reality, native Korean speakers rarely use the word ‘you’ in sentences, especially when speaking in 존댓말, or formal language.

You can use the word 당신 when:
1. you are angry at someone and don’t mind fighting or arguing with that person;
2. you are translating from a foreign language and you absolutely must have a word for ‘you’;
3. you are writing or singing a song, or are using indirect language in general;
4. you are addressing your spouse (commonly used among middle-aged or older people);
5. (rare case) you are talking about someone (who is not present) in an honorific way and
want to say ‘he’ or ‘she’.

### Usage 1
```
당신 뭐야?
= Who do you think you are? / What are you?

당신 뭐가 문제야?
= What’s your problem?
```
Using 당신 in this fashion evokes the feeling that you really don’t mind getting in a quarrel or
a fight with the other person. Note that you are not speaking entirely in 존댓말 anymore. If
you are already speaking in 반말, you would say “너”.

### Usage 2 & 3
```
당신의 눈은 참 아름다워요.
= Your eyes are so beautiful.
당신에게 이 노래를 바칩니다.
= I dedicate this song to you.
```
You are forced to use 당신 here because you do not know the name of the other person
without context.

### Usage 4
```
당신 지금 어디예요?
= Honey, where are you?
```
Other words which can replace 당신 in this usage are 여보 (most common) and 자기 (more
common among young couples).

### Usage 5

This is becoming more and more rare. Often at times, people drop the word 당신 simply
out of fear of being misunderstood.

### in 반말

say ‘너’
> 너 + 는 [topic] = 너는
>
> 너 + 가 [subject] = 네가 (written) or 니가 (spoken)

### in 존댓말

say the name of the other person and add suffixes such as `-씨`, `-님`, or a word which describes his or her position or job title.
```
현우 씨 지금 시간 있어요?
= (Talking to 현우) Do you have time now?
최경은 선생님, 어디예요?
= (Talking to teacher 최경은) Where are you?
기사님, 여기에서 내려 주세요.
= (Talking to the taxi driver) Please drop me off here.
```

## It’s okay, I’m okay. / 괜찮아요.

> Present tense = 괜찮아요.
> 
> Past tense = 괜찮았어요.
> 
> Future tense = 괜찮을 거예요.

Usage
1. I am okay/I am alright/Everything is fine.
2. Don’t worry/No worries
3. It’s good
4. I’m cool/I am good/No, thanks


## It is okay to ..., You don’t have to ... / -아/어/여도 돼요, 안 -아/어/여도 돼요

```
지금 인터넷 돼요?
= Does the Internet work now?
지금 배달 돼요?
= Can you deliver the food now? / Is food delivery available now?
배달 돼요?
= Do you deliver food as well? / Can food delivery be done?
```

-아/어/여 + -도 means ‘even if’ or ‘even when’

So,

-아/어/여 + -도 + 되다 = -아/어/여도 되다 means ‘it is okay to...’ or ‘it is okay even if you...’.

```
켜도 돼요. = It’s okay. You can turn it on.
내일 해도 돼요? = Is it okay if I do it tomorrow?
시작해도 돼요. = You can start.
시작해도 돼요? = Can I start? / Can we start?
```
### Negative
(-아/어/여 + -도 + 되다) and adding 안 in front of it, you can say
‘don’t have to...’ or ‘it is not necessary to...’.

:::danger Note
안 + -아/어/여 + -도 + 되다 does NOT translate to ‘you shouldn’t...’
:::

```
청소 안 해도 돼요. = You don’t have to clean up. / It is okay if you don’t clean up.
안 마셔도 돼요. = You don’t have to drink. / It’s okay if you don’t drink.

:::

## You shouldn’t ..., You’re not supposed to ... / -(으)면 안 돼요

`‘it is not okay if...’ or ‘it is not acceptable if...’`, and it can be
more naturally translated to `‘you shouldn’t...’ or ‘you’re not supposed to...’`

> Conjugation:
> 
> Verb stem + -(으)면 안 되다

:::details Break Down
-(으)면 안 되다 can be broken into two parts: 
-(으)면 and 안 되다. 

-(으) 면 means ‘if' and 되다 means ‘to work’, ‘to function’, ‘to be possible’, or ‘can do’. 
Therefore, 안 되다 means ‘it can’t be done’, ‘it’s not possible’, or ‘it is not okay’.
:::

```
열면 안 돼요.
= You shouldn’t open it. / You are not supposed to open it.
열면 안 돼요?
