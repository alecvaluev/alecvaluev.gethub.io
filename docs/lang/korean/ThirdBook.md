## Future Tense / -(으)ᄅ 거예요 vs -(으)ᄅ게요

`-(으)ᄅ 거예요` is the most basic way to express a future plan or action. It's used to express intention or plan for a future action or expectation for a
future state. This is NOT related to or affected by the reaction or the request of the other
person in the conversation.

```
보내 + -ᄅ 거예요 = 보낼 거예요 = I will send/ I am going to send
웃 + -을 거예요 = 웃을 거예요 = I will laugh
```

`-(으)ᄅ게요` is also expresses the future, but it focuses more on actions or decisions AS A REACTION TO or AS A RESULT OF what the other person says or thinks.
```

= I will study.

## To look like, To seem like (used with nouns) / 같다
First, take a look at how to express that something is similar to something else.

`비슷하다 = to be similar`

To say “A is similar to B”, you need to use `-(이)랑` or `-하고`.

A랑 비슷해요. = It’s similar to A.

B하고 비슷해요. = It’s similar to B.

```
Ex)
도쿄는 서울하고 비슷해요?
= Is Tokyo similar to Seoul?
참외는 멜론하고 비슷해요.
= Chamoe (Korean melon) is similar to melon.
```

Now look at the word for “to be the same”

`같다 = to be the same`

`-(이)랑` or `-하고` is used here as well.

A랑 같아요. = It’s the same as A.

A하고 B는 같아요. = A and B are the same.

```
Ex)
이거랑 이거랑 같아요?
= Is this the same as this? / Are these two things the same?
우리는 나이가 같아요.
= We have the same age. (lit. For us, the age is the same.)
```

> However, the word 같다, which means “to be the same”, without the particle -(이)랑 or -하
고, has a different meaning.

> Conjugation
> Noun + 같다 = to be like + Noun / to look like + Noun / to seem to be + Noun

```
Ex)
커피 같아요.   = It’s like coffee. / It seems to be coffee. / It looks like coffee.

거짓말 같아요. = It seems to be a lie. / It sounds like a lie.

로봇 같아요.   = It’s like a robot. / It seems to be a robot. / It looks like a robot.
```

### Sample Sentences
```
그 이야기는 거짓말 같아요.
= That story sounds like a lie.

이 강아지는 고양이 같아요.
= This puppy is like a cat.
```

## To look like, To seem like (used with verbs) / -(으)ᄂ/는/(으)ᄅ 것 같아요
When using 같아요 with verbs, however, the verb needs to be changed into its noun form.
There are a few different ways to change a verb into a noun,

### Descriptive verbs
> V + -(으)ᄂ 것

### Action verbs
> Present: V + -는 것
> 
> Past: V + -(으)ᄂ 것               
> 
> Future: V + -(으)ᄅ 것

What does - 것 같아요 mean?

Even when 같아요 is combined with a verb, since - 것 makes the verb a noun, the basic
meaning and usage is the same as “Noun + 같아요”.

1. “It looks like...”
2. “It seems to be...”
3. “To me it looks like...”
4. “I think it is...”
5. “I think it will...”
6. “I think it was....”

```
이상하 + ᄂ 것 같아요 = 이상한 것 같아요.
= It seems to be strange. / I think it is strange.

눈이 오다 = to snow
눈이 오 + 는 것 같아요 = 눈이 오는 것 같아요.
= It seems to be snowing. / I think it is snowing.

이야기하 + ᄂ 것 같아요 = 이야기한 것 같아요.
= I think they told them. / It looks like they talked.
```

## Before -ing / -기 전에

`N + 전에 = before (+ noun)`

```ko
수업 전에 = before class
일요일 전에 = before Sunday
```
to use it with verbs such as “going” or “leaving”, the verbs need to be changed into nouns.

In this case, -기 is used to change the verbs into nouns.

```ko
가다 → 가기 (going) → 가기 전에 = before going
사다 → 사기 (buying)→ 사기 전에 = before buying
```
```ko
친구들하고 놀기 전에 숙제할 거예요.
= I’m going to do homework before I hang out with (my) friends.
도망가기 전에 잡으세요.
= Catch him before he runs away.
