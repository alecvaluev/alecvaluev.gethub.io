```
한 달 = one month

together or 약 and 정도 together.


## Future Tense / -(으)ᄅ 거예요 vs -(으)ᄅ게요

`-(으)ᄅ 거예요` is the most basic way to express a future plan or action. It's used to express intention or plan for a future action or expectation for a
future state. This is NOT related to or affected by the reaction or the request of the other
person in the conversation.

```
보내 + -ᄅ 거예요 = 보낼 거예요 = I will send/ I am going to send
웃 + -을 거예요 = 웃을 거예요 = I will laugh
```

`-(으)ᄅ게요` is also expresses the future, but it focuses more on actions or decisions AS A REACTION TO or AS A RESULT OF what the other person says or thinks.
```
공부할 거예요.
= I am going to study.
= I will study.

* Regardless of what the other person says, you were ALREADY planning to study, and the other
person will not change your mind.

## To look like, To seem like (used with nouns) / 같다
First, take a look at how to express that something is similar to something else.

`비슷하다 = to be similar`

To say “A is similar to B”, you need to use `-(이)랑` or `-하고`.

A랑 비슷해요. = It’s similar to A.

B하고 비슷해요. = It’s similar to B.

```
Ex)
도쿄는 서울하고 비슷해요?
= Is Tokyo similar to Seoul?
참외는 멜론하고 비슷해요.
= Chamoe (Korean melon) is similar to melon.
```

Now look at the word for “to be the same”

`같다 = to be the same`

`-(이)랑` or `-하고` is used here as well.

A랑 같아요. = It’s the same as A.

A하고 B는 같아요. = A and B are the same.

```
Ex)
이거랑 이거랑 같아요?
= Is this the same as this? / Are these two things the same?
우리는 나이가 같아요.
= We have the same age. (lit. For us, the age is the same.)
```

> However, the word 같다, which means “to be the same”, without the particle -(이)랑 or -하
고, has a different meaning.

> Conjugation
> Noun + 같다 = to be like + Noun / to look like + Noun / to seem to be + Noun

```
Ex)
커피 같아요.   = It’s like coffee. / It seems to be coffee. / It looks like coffee.

거짓말 같아요. = It seems to be a lie. / It sounds like a lie.

로봇 같아요.   = It’s like a robot. / It seems to be a robot. / It looks like a robot.
```

### Sample Sentences
```
그 이야기는 거짓말 같아요.
= That story sounds like a lie.
이 강아지는 고양이 같아요.
= This puppy is like a cat.
```

## To look like, To seem like (used with verbs) / -(으)ᄂ/는/(으)ᄅ 것 같아요
When using 같아요 with verbs, however, the verb needs to be changed into its noun form.
There are a few different ways to change a verb into a noun,

### Descriptive verbs
> V + -(으)ᄂ 것

### Action verbs
> Present: V + -는 것
> 
> Past: V + -(으)ᄂ 것               
> 
> Future: V + -(으)ᄅ 것

What does - 것 같아요 mean?

Even when 같아요 is combined with a verb, since - 것 makes the verb a noun, the basic
meaning and usage is the same as “Noun + 같아요”.

1. “It looks like...”
2. “It seems to be...”
3. “To me it looks like...”
4. “I think it is...”
5. “I think it will...”
6. “I think it was....”

```
이상하 + ᄂ 것 같아요 = 이상한 것 같아요.
= It seems to be strange. / I think it is strange.

눈이 오다 = to snow
눈이 오 + 는 것 같아요 = 눈이 오는 것 같아요.
= It seems to be snowing. / I think it is snowing.

이야기하 + ᄂ 것 같아요 = 이야기한 것 같아요.
= I think they told them. / It looks like they talked.
```

## Before -ing / -기 전에

`N + 전에 = before (+ noun)`

```
수업 전에 = before class
일요일 전에 = before Sunday
```
to use it with verbs such as “going” or “leaving”, the verbs need to be changed into nouns.

In this case, -기 is used to change the verbs into nouns.

```
가다 → 가기 (going) → 가기 전에 = before going
사다 → 사기 (buying)→ 사기 전에 = before buying
```
```
친구들하고 놀기 전에 숙제할 거예요.
= I’m going to do homework before I hang out with (my) friends.
도망가기 전에 잡으세요.
= Catch him before he runs away.
```
## Irregular ㅂ
that if a verb has ᄇ at the end of the verb stem, and it is followed by a suffix which starts with a vowel, the ᄇ will change

> Conjugation
> 
> If the vowel before ᄇ is 오, change ᄇ to 오.
> 
> If the vowel before ᄇ is not 오, change ᄇ to 우.

```
돕다 = to help
= 도 + ᄇ + 다 → 도 + 오 + 아요 = 도와요
* Note that it is NOT 돕아요
[present tense] 도와요
[past tense] 도왔어요
[future tense] 도울 거예요

어렵다 = to be difficult
= 어려 + ᄇ + 다 → 어려 + 우 + 어요 = 어려워요
[present tense] 어려워요
[past tense] 어려웠어요
[future tense] 어려울 거예요
```

### Some other irregular words
```
눕다 = to lie down → 누워요.
굽다 = to bake → 구워요.
덥다 = to be hot (weather) → 더워요.
쉽다 = to be easy → 쉬워요.
맵다 = to be spicy → 매워요.
귀엽다 = to be cute → 귀여워요.
밉다 = to hate; to be dislikeable → 미워요.
아름답다 = to be beautiful → 아름다워요.
```
::: danger Note
with suffixes such as -는 or -고, ᄇ does not change.
:::

There are a handful of verbs which do not follow this rule. The ᄇ in these words does not change when in front of a vowel.
```
Action verbs:
- 입다 = to wear
- 잡다 = to catch
- 씹다 = to bite

Descriptive verbs:
- 좁다 = to be narrow
- 넓다 = to be wide
```

```
서울은 겨울에 정말 추워요.
= In Seoul, it’s really cold in the winter.
이 문제는 어려워요.
= This problem is difficult.
```
## But still, Nevertheless / 그래도
`그래도 means “but still”, “however”, “nonetheless”, or “nevertheless”.`

> Let’s break it down:
> 그래도 = 그래 + 도
> 그래 = 그렇게 해 or 그렇게 하여 (to do it in such a way, to do that)
> -도 = also, too, even
 
The literal meaning of “그래 + 도” is “even if you do that”, “even if that happens”, or “if you do that, too” with the meaning of “still” added to the context.

:::tip Fact
If you feel the need to be more polite, or if you want to make 100% sure you are not being
rude, add -요 to the end and say, “그래도요”. The “도요” combination takes a bit of work to
pronounce, so you may find that other people, especially women in Seoul, end up saying “그
래두요” rather than “그래도요”
:::

```
어제는 비가 왔어요. 그래도 축구를 했어요.
= Yesterday, it rained. Nevertheless, we played soccer.
저도 돈이 없어요. 그래도 걱정하지 마세요.
= I don’t have money, either. But still, don’t worry.
```

## Making Adjectives (Part 1) / adjectives in infinitive form + -(으)ᄂ + 명사
“To be + adjective” aka “infinitive form” in English, also referred to as “descriptive verb form”.

바쁘다 → It does NOT mean “busy”. It means “to be busy”.

> Conjugation
> - Verb stems ending with a vowel + -ᄂ
> - Verb stems ending with a consonant + -은

```
→ 조용하 + -ᄂ → 조용한 방 = a quiet room
→ 작 + -은 → 작은 집 = a small house
```

::: warning Exceptions
하얗다 → 하얀 = white [NOT 하얗은]

그렇다 → 그런 = such [NOT 그렇은]

달다 → 단 = sweet [NOT 달은]

The descriptive verbs 있다 and 없다 are also an exception because they are combined with -는;
this includes verbs that end in -있다 and -없다, such as 재미있다, 맛있다, 재미없다, etc.
:::

### Commin mistake
all adjectives are in the infinitive form already, it is INCORRECT to conjugate them with -이에요.

`예쁜이에요 ( x )`

Adjectives in the infinitive form need to be conjugated just like action verbs.

`예쁘다 → 예뻐요 ( o )`


```
이상한 사람이에요.  = He’s a strange person.
이상한 사람이에요.  = He’s a strange person.
```

## Making Adjectives (Part 2) / action verbs + -는 + 명사
Action verbs can be conjugated to be used as adjectives, too!

> Conjugation
> 
> V + -는

```
가다 -> 가는
자다 -> 자는
```
For verb stems ending with ᄅ, drop ᄅ and add -는.
```
열다 -> 여는
불다 -> 부는
```

The adjective in certain sentences can actually be an adjective clause
```
좋아하는 책 = a book that I/you/they/someone like(s)
내가/제가 안 좋아하는 책 = a book that I don’t like

좋아하는 사람
= someone who someone likes
= someone I like
```

### Sample Sentences
```
이 노래는 제가 좋아하는 노래예요.
= This song is a song that I like.
자주 먹는 한국 음식 있어요?
= Is there a Korean food that you eat often?
요즘 공부하고 있는 외국어는 일본어예요.
= The foreign language I am studying these days is Japanese.
```

## Well then, In that case, If so / 그러면, 그럼
`그러면 = in that case; if so; then`

그러면 is a combination of 그렇다, which means “to be so”, and -면.

> A shorter version of 그러면 => 그럼

```
지금 바빠요? 그러면 언제 안 바빠요?
= You’re busy now? Then WHEN are you not busy?
한국 음식 좋아해요? 그럼 김밥도 좋아해요?
= Do you like Korean food? Then do you like kimbap, too?
진짜요? 그럼 이제 어떻게 해요?
= Really? If so, what do we do now?
```

:::tip Fact
As an adverb, 그럼 (shortening of 그러면) indeed means ‘then’ or ‘in that case’. However, the
interjection 그럼 (or 그럼요 in polite form) means ‘of course!’ or ‘naturally!’ Depending on the
context you can distinguish the difference between the two.
:::

## Let’s / -아/어/여요 (청유형)

There are a few different ways to say “let’s” in Korean:

1. -아/어/여요 [polite/plain]
2. -(으)시죠 [honorific]
3. -자 [informal]
4. -(으)ㄹ래요? [polite/casual]
5. -(으)실래요? [polite/formal]

The most frequently used form is the first example above, `-아/어/여요`

### Sample Sentences 
```
저도 서점에 갈 거예요. 같이 가요!
= I’m going to the bookstore, too. Let’s go together!
배 안 고파요? 우리 햄버거 먹어요.
= Aren’t you hungry? Let’s eat hamburgers.
```

## In order to, For the sake of / 위해, 위해서

## Nothing but, Only / -밖에 + 부정형
